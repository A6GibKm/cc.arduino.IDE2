		<p>
            		Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based
            		on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software.  It's intended for
            		artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating
            		interactive objects or environments.
		</p>
		<p>
            		Included is an integrated development environment that can be used
            		to develop and upload code to compatible microcontrollers.
        	</p>
		<p>
			The new major release of the Arduino IDE is faster and even more powerful! 
			In addition to a more modern editor and a more responsive interface it features 
			autocompletion, code navigation, and even a live debugger.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Flatpak build of Arduino IDE 2.x requires the user to have USB permissions to upload a sketch, preferably, the user has to be part of the dialout group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, add the following 2 lines to /etc/udev/rules.d/50-arduino.rules:
		</p>
		<p>
			KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*",MODE="0666"
		</p>
		<p>
			KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*",MODE="0666"
